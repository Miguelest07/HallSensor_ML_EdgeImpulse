# HallSensor_ML_EdgeImpulse
The project is a section of the training course "Introduction to Embedded Machine Learning", by hawn Hymel, the main instructor in collaboration with Edge Impulse

#Intro
I chose a simple 12v fan for measuring the rotational velocity in 4 states (OFF, LOW, MED, HIGH), for achieving that I attached a magnet on a blade of the fan and I added up a hall sensor for measuring the magnetism when the magnet gets closer to the sensor.
